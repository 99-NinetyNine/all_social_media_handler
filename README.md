Actually, people can use Meta Business to CRUD fb and instagram.

I researched and found similar products as well..

What I wanted to build was:
=> A system that has simple UI
=>User provides [Photo, text+photo, or others]
=> we make filter(size, length, media type etc attributes)
=> we post that in the social media

Well this is not going to save a  lot of time, this has potential to save few minutes of those person who have to post to multiple media.

Challenges might be, not all social media could provide API and complex user interaction might be needed.

Anyways, I could not resist Myself automating these minor things, and I felt demotivated after I got "not to collaorative" response from my friends, so this project is not "active". 

Haha, But i know this is GEM.
